# CLIMATE MONITORING SYSTEM
## INTRODUCTION
In this project we use the open-source Arduino UNO microcontroller that is based on ATmega328P and Arduino IDE as the software development platform.

In this project, we use different types of sensors to acquire information about the current state of the weather (Temperature sensor to measure current temperature, humidity sensor to measure the percentage of water in the air and so on …) 

After the measurements have been taken, the microcontroller then acts accordingly by activating the corresponding device (i.e. AC or humidifier) to adjust these weather conditions to values pre-programmed optimum conditions. But for the sake of this project, it is assumed that just displaying the values of the sensors on an LCD screen is enough.
